# animal-ai-e2e
A suite of E2E tests for AAI.

This is the package that (hopefully) will eventually become a suite of E2E tests we can use in CI/CD for Animal-AI. Right now I've just dumped the tests I hacked together the multi arena episodes feature here that we can use as a starting point.

Tasks of turning this into a proper test suite (get good coverage over use cases, use a proper testing framework ...) tracked in https://www.notion.so/763741e558da4edb992b199a1233f169?v=da4b83d65c6b4ced81744d180b36001b&p=19c3c7c87da84dd0b42ff38bc2af0350&pm=s
